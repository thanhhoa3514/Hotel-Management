# 7-Step Workflow: Leveraging AI for Prod Code

This outlines the process from initial design to production deployment, detailing the steps and AI's role.

## 1. Technical Design Document (TDD)

- Always start with a TDD.
- The TDD originates from a proposal doc.
- Once stakeholders agree on the proposal's merit, develop the full system design (architecture, team integrations, etc.).

## 2. Design Review

- Conduct a Design Review before starting development.
- The team's design document must be rigorously reviewed ("shredded") by Senior Engineers.
- **Goal:** Front-load the pain by identifying major issues early.

## 3. Launch Development Effort

- Upon passing the review, initiate development.
- The first few weeks are dedicated to creating more documentation for each subsystem, to be built by individual development teams.

## 4. Backlog Development and Sprint Planning

- Devs collaborate with PMs (Product Managers) and TPMs (Technical Program Managers) to define discrete tasks and their order for individual developers.

## 5. Software Development

- Hands on keyboard; start crushing task tickets.
- **AI as a Force Multiplier:** AI agents are used strategically here.
- Using **Test Driven Development (TDD)**: The AI coding agent must **write the tests first** for the feature being built.
- Only after the tests are written, the AI agent is used to **build out the feature** itself.

## 6. Code Submission Review

- Enforce a **two-developer approval process** before code is merged into the main branch.
- **AI's Role:** AI shows great promise in assisting with the code review process.

## 7. Test in Staging

- Code is deployed and tested in the staging environment.
- If staging is confirmed "good to go," the code is pushed to production (`prod`).
