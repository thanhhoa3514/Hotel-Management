## üöß C·∫¶N HO√ÄN TH√ÄNH (To Complete)

### 1. Mappers (Follow GuestMapper pattern)

- [ ] StaffMapper
- [ ] RoomTypeMapper
- [ ] RoomMapper
- [ ] RoomImageMapper
- [ ] ServiceMapper
- [ ] ReservationMapper (complex)
- [ ] PaymentMapper
- [ ] InvoiceMapper
- [ ] AuditLogMapper

### 2. Service Implementations (Follow GuestServiceImpl pattern)

- [ ] StaffServiceImpl
- [ ] RoomTypeServiceImpl
- [ ] RoomServiceImpl
- [ ] RoomImageServiceImpl
- [ ] ServiceManagementServiceImpl
- [ ] ReservationServiceImpl (most complex)
- [ ] PaymentServiceImpl
- [ ] InvoiceServiceImpl
- [ ] AuditLogServiceImpl

### 3. Controllers (Follow GuestController pattern)

- [ ] StaffController
- [ ] RoomTypeController (NEW)
- [ ] RoomController (update to use IRoomService)
- [ ] RoomImageController (NEW)
- [ ] ServiceController (hotel services)
- [ ] ReservationController (update)
- [ ] PaymentController (update)
- [ ] InvoiceController (update)
- [ ] AuditLogController (update)

### 4. Clean Up Old Code

- [ ] Delete User.java entity (replaced by Guest/Staff + Keycloak)
- [ ] Delete UserService.java
- [ ] Delete UserController.java
- [ ] Delete UserRepository.java
- [ ] Delete old UserRequest/UserResponse DTOs
- [ ] Delete old EntityMapper.java (replaced by individual mappers)

### 5. Update Existing Components

- [ ] Update AuditAspect to work with UUID
- [ ] Update SecurityConfig for Keycloak JWT
- [ ] Fix old controllers that still reference old services

### 6. Testing

- [ ] Unit tests for GuestService (example included)
- [ ] Unit tests for other services
- [ ] Integration tests
- [ ] API tests with Swagger

### 7. Final Documentation

- [ ] Update README.md with new API endpoints
- [ ] Create API documentation
- [ ] Migration guide from old to new structure
- [ ] Deployment guide

## üìä Statistics

- **Total Entities**: 17 (including enums)
- **Service Interfaces**: 10
- **Repositories**: 12
- **DTOs**: 20+ (Request + Response)
- **Controllers**: 10 (to be created/updated)
- **Mappers**: 10 (to be created)
- **Service Implementations**: 10 (to be created)

## üéØ Estimated Remaining Work

- **Mappers**: ~2-3 hours (following GuestMapper pattern)
- **Service Implementations**: ~5-6 hours (ReservationServiceImpl most complex)
- **Controllers**: ~2-3 hours (updating existing + creating new)
- **Testing**: ~4-5 hours
- **Documentation**: ~2 hours
- **Total**: ~15-20 hours

## üöÄ How to Continue

### Option 1: Follow the Pattern

Use `GuestMapper.java`, `GuestServiceImpl.java`, and `GuestController.java` as templates. Copy and adapt for each entity.

### Option 2: Use Implementation Guide

Follow `IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md` step by step for detailed instructions.

### Option 3: Automated Generation

Use IDE code generation or templates to speed up repetitive parts.

## üìù Key Improvements Over Original Design

1. **SOLID Compliance**: All services use interfaces
2. **No User Table**: Direct Keycloak integration
3. **Lookup Tables**: RoomType for better flexibility
4. **Many-to-Many**: Reservations can have multiple rooms
5. **Room Images**: Support for image galleries
6. **Hotel Services**: Extensible services module
7. **Itemized Invoicing**: InvoiceDetails for transparency
8. **Better Audit**: UUID-based with IP tracking

## üîó Quick Links

- Database Schema: `docs/db.sql`
- Init Scripts: `init-scripts/02-init-hotel-schema.sql`
- Architecture Doc: `ARCHITECTURE.md`
- Implementation Guide: `IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md`
- Example Service: `GuestServiceImpl.java`

## üí° Tips for Completion

1. **Start with simpler services** (Staff, RoomType)
2. **Leave complex ones for later** (Reservation, Payment)
3. **Test each service** before moving to next
4. **Use Swagger UI** to verify endpoints
5. **Follow the pattern** established in GuestService

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes

- All services MUST implement their interface
- All controllers MUST depend on interface, not implementation
- Use `@Auditable` annotation on create/update/delete methods
- Validate business rules in service layer, not controller
- Use proper exception handling (ResourceNotFoundException, DuplicateResourceException, BusinessException)
